/* Image presenter: the only host code that puts pictures into the game's frame. A mod asks for a
 * picture at a place on the game screen (320 x 224, game coordinates); the presenter shows it every
 * frame until hidden, in the best way available. Callers never touch VRAM or the framebuffer.
 *
 * Methods (backends), chosen per picture or automatically:
 *   BOX     one opaque rectangle pasted into the finished frame (PE_HOOK_FRAME_DRAWN): see-through
 *           pixels show the box colour.
 *   STRIPS  only the picture's covered pixels (alpha >= 128) pasted, row by row, at the same hook:
 *           what the game drew stays visible around it. Hard edges. Slow: each strip is one PsyZ
 *           upload (~50 us each; ~11 ms a frame for a 128 x 128 card at 2x), so not for real use
 *           until the engine offers a masked or batched upload.
 * Nothing is pasted while the display is in 24-bit mode (movies).
 * Both sit on top of everything the game drew that frame (cursor, pop-ups included). Nothing is
 * read back from the screen (PsyZ's read-back is stale at internal resolution > 1), and nothing is
 * left behind: a pasted picture exists only in the frame it was pasted into.
 * Later backends (a borrowed texture page, an engine image) are added here; callers don't change. */
